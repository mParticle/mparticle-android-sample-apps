# Adding a kit to a local mParticle sample app project

Use these quick, step-by-step instructions to integrate a kit to a local sample app project:

1. Navigate to the app/libs folder using command `cd app/libs` (you can use the Tab key to autocomplete the path).

    * path should be similar to: *..\mparticle-android-sample-apps\core-sdk-samples\higgs-shop-sample-app\app\libs*

2. Clone the git repository using the command `git clone` *kit repo url*

3. Navigate to the repository folder using the command `cd` *kit name* or use the Tab key, path name should now have the kit repository name.

4. Check out a branch or create a new one using the command `git checkout` *branch name* or `git checkout -b` *new branch name*

5. Add the kit implementation to the app's *module-level build.gradle.kts file*: `implementation(project(":mparticle-android-integration-*replace with kit name*"))`

6. Include the kit in the project-level `settings.gradle` file:   
   `include ':mparticle-android-integration-`*replace with kit name*
   `project(':mparticle-android-integration-*replace with kit name*').projectDir = new File('app/libs/mparticle-android-integration-`*replace with kit name*)

7. Finally, add the sample app credentials on the main class cdHiggsShopSampleApplication() replacing .credentials(*your apiKey,*your apiSecret*)

You can now test your kit integration. Place a breakpoint inside the kit's `onCreate()` and run the app in debug mode. If the kit is integrated, the breakpoint should trigger, indicating the kit is being initialized.

# Adding the SDK to a local mParticle sample app project.

Due to the complexity of the multi-module configuration of the SDK, adding it directly as an operable module in the sample app is not currently supported. Different steps must be taken to *build the SDK locally and add it as a dependency.*

1. Fork a local copy of the SDK repository. In this local copy you must make *all the configuration changes that you wish to see implemented on your local sample app* before you make a local build.

2. After your changes are made, run the command  `./gradlew publishReleaseLocal`.  This command creates a local snapshot of the SDK.

3. Finally, in the sample app's *module-level build.gradle.kts* file, replace the original core implementation with yours. You can find the name in your local **m2** folder. The dependency should contain the word "SNAPSHOT." The complete dependency should be similar to the following: `implementation("com.mparticle:android-core:#.##.#-SNAPSHOT"`.
